## Alpha-Beta 0.0.0v
This is the initial version of the project. However, some progress has already been made, including:
- Research on STonFi contracts on the TON blockchain.
- Research on UniSwap contracts on Ethereum.
- Development of an initial version of the API server (which will need to be rewritten).
Some mathematical aspects may need to be reviewed, particularly due to the challenges of working with integer operations, which has been a bit of a pain point. Future versions are planned to include support for additional protocols, possibly starting with one on Solana and later adding support for Tron to increase diversity.
